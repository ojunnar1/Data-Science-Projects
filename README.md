Data Science Projects
This is a outline of my Data Science and Machine Learning Projects.

## Salary Prediction based on Job Types

Training and testing dataset is provided. Objective is to develop machine learning models, determine the best model and predict the salaries based on job types.

## House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

Kaggle Competition. Training and testing dataset is provided. Objective is to predict sales prices of houses by applying various machine learning models, regression techniques and feature engineering.

## Mercari Price Suggestion

Kaggle Competition.Training and testing dataset is provided. Objective is to develop models which would automatically suggest the right prices for various products. Different types of natural language processing techniques are used in this project.
